## Transformers
  - Transformers provides api for easily download and train state of the art pre-trained model
  - Benefits of pre-trained model : 
    - Reduced computational cost
    - Reduced carbon foot prints
    - save time and resource required to train a model from scratch
    -  these models can support diffrent task in different modalities
    - Eg : NLP, Computer Vision, Audio, multimodel
    - Transformers support framework interoperability between PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX.
    -  Models can also be exported to a format like ```ONNX ```and ```TorchScript``` for deployment in production environments.
